		<div class="main-text">
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Mississippie has a poverty rate of 19.75%. Almost one in 5 people in Mississippie don't make enough money to souport their family. </p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> That is one kid who can't get a lunch. Another kid who cant afford new shoes. A hard working mom who can't afford her lunch. </p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Poverty isn't just a lack of money. It isn't just being behind on your rent. It isn't just skipping lunch to save money, poverty is a pandemic. A hidden pandemic. </p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Their are multiple things that cause poverty. One of the main things is the minimum wage. Right now the minimum wage is so low, that if you work full time at it you will just barely make enough money to be above the poverty line. Poverty isn't made by bad people who failed in life, but rather the unlucky. When you have a child you need to make more money to souport both you and the child, but esspeascilay if your a single parent, it can be really hard to make enough money to sustain both you and the child.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Alot of the time its not the workers fault for being in poverty. Lots of jobs dont pay enough. The workers cant sustain themselfs on the little bits of money that they get. If we wanted to fix poverty in America, then we need to start with raising the minimum wage. If you can't pay both your bills and your childs child care, then we shouldn't blame you. We should help you, by raising the minium wage to an ammount where a single parent can have a child and not worry about if they can pay rent or not. </p>
