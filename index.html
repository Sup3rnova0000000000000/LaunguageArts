		<div class="main-text">
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Mississippi has a poverty rate of 19.75%. Almost one in 5 people in Mississippi don't make enough money to support their family.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> That is one kid who can't get a lunch. A hard-working mom who can't afford her dinner. A child not getting Christmas presents.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> Poverty isn't just a lack of money. It isn't just being behind on your rent. It isn't just skipping lunch to save money; poverty is a pandemic. A hidden pandemic.  </p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> There are multiple things that cause poverty. One of the main things is the minimum wage. Right now, the minimum wage is so low, that if you work full time at it you will just barely make enough money to be above the poverty line. Poverty isn't made by bad people who failed in life, but rather the unlucky. When you have a child, you need to make more money to support both you and the child, but especially if you’re a single parent, it can be really hard to make enough money to sustain both you and the child. <p>
			<p style="font-size: 28;"> A lot of the time it’s not the workers fault for being in poverty. Lots of jobs don’t pay enough. The workers can’t sustain themselves on the little bits of money that they get. If we wanted to fix poverty in America, then we need to start with raising the minimum wage. If you can't pay both your bills and your child’s childcare, then we shouldn't blame you. We should help you, by raising the minimum wage to an amount where a single parent can have a child and not worry about if they can pay rent or not. </p>
